    <p>Dr. Strange is a fictional superhero who appears in comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is also known as
        the Sorcerer Supreme, the primary protector of Earth against magical and mystical threats. He was created by
        artist Steve Ditko and writer Stan Lee, and first appeared in Strange Tales #110 in July 19631.

        Dr. Strange’s origin story is that he was once a brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon who suffered a car accident
        that damaged his hands and prevented him from performing surgery. Desperate to find a cure, he traveled the
        world in search of alternative methods of healing, until he encountered the Ancient One, a powerful sorcerer who
        taught him the secrets of the mystic arts. Dr. Strange became his apprentice and learned to master both the
        mystical and the martial arts, as well as acquiring various magical objects, such as the Eye of Agamotto, the
        Cloak of Levitation, and the Book of the Vishanti. He also moved into a mansion called the Sanctum Sanctorum,
        located at 177A Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, New York City, where he is assisted by his friend and valet
        Wong2.

        Dr. Strange has been involved in many adventures and battles with various enemies and allies, both on Earth and
        in other dimensions. Some of his most notable foes include Dormammu, Baron Mordo, Nightmare, Shuma-Gorath, and
        Thanos. Some of his most notable allies include Clea, his former lover and disciple; the Scarlet Witch, a
        powerful mutant and magic user; Spider-Man, a fellow superhero and friend; and the Avengers, a team of Earth’s
        mightiest heroes. Dr. Strange is also a founding member of the Defenders, a group of heroes who deal with
        supernatural and cosmic threats, and a member of the Illuminati, a secret cabal of influential individuals who
        shape the world’s events2.

        Dr. Strange has been adapted into various media, including animated series, video games, and live-action films.
        The most recent and popular adaptation is the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where he is portrayed by Benedict
        Cumberbatch. He made his debut in the 2016 film Doctor Strange, which follows his origin story and his
        confrontation with Kaecilius, a rogue disciple of the Ancient One who seeks to unleash Dormammu, the dark lord
        of the Dark Dimension. He then appeared in Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Avengers:
        Endgame (2019), and Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), where he plays a key role in the events of the Infinity
        Saga. He will also star in his upcoming sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022), which will
        explore the consequences of his actions in Spider-Man: No Way Home and introduce new characters and realities to
        the MCU34.
